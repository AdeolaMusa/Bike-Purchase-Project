## Problem Statement
- What is the Average income per Customers?
- Which region has the highest impact on the sales?
- What Age bracket purchased bike more?
- What is the Average distance of customers commute?

## Skills / Concept demonstrated
I used Power Query to clean and transform the data while using Power Pivot to analyse and create models. Other tools used includes; slicers, filters, DAX. Leveraging visualization tools, I created charts, graphs, and pivot tables to showcase key Performance metrics.

Filter                     |  Purchase

## Analysis
- Average income by purchase ![](Average_income_by_purchase.png):
   
The average income of female customers that purchased bikes is $55,774
The average income of male customers that pirchased bikes is $60,124
This implies that male customers who purchased bikes have a higher income compared to female customers who purchased bikes.
